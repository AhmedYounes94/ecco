Ecco is made up of two components:

- [Ecco](https://github.com/jalammar/ecco), a python component. Wraps around language models and collects relevant data. 
- [EccoJS](https://github.com/jalammar/eccojs), a Javascript component used to create interactive explorables from the outputs of Ecco.

All the machine learning happens in the Ecco. The results can be plotted by python, or interactive explorables are created using eccoJS.
